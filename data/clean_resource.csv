Thiscase study explores the performance impact of network sizes when consideringactor and critic architectures independently. By relaxing the assumption ofarchitectural symmetry  it is often possible for smaller actors to achievecomparable policy performance to their symmetric counterparts. Our experimentsshow up to 97% reduction in the number of network weights with an averagereduction of 64% over multiple algorithms on multiple tasks. Given thepractical benefits of reducing actor complexity  we believe configurations ofactors and critics are aspects of actor-critic design that deserve to beconsidered independently.
11893,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11893, Targeted False Data Injection Attack against DC State Estimation without  Line Parameters,A novel false data injection attack (FDIA) model against DC state estimationis proposed  which requires no network parameters and exploits only limitedphasor measurement unit (PMU) data. The proposed FDIA model can target specificstates and launch large deviation attacks using estimated line parameters.Sufficient conditions for the proposed method are also presented. Differentattack vectors are studied in the IEEE 39-bus system  showing that the proposedFDIA method can successfully bypass the bad data detection (BDD) with highsuccess rates of up to 95.3%.
11896,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11896, Construction of arbitrary order finite element degree-of-freedom maps on  polygonal and polyhedral cell meshes,We develop an approach to generating degree-of-freedom maps for arbitraryorder finite element spaces for any cell shape. The approach is based on thecomposition of permutations and transformations by cell sub-entity. Currentapproaches to generating degree-of-freedom maps for arbitrary order problemstypically rely on a consistent orientation of cell entities that permits thedefinition of a common local coordinate system on shared edges and faces.However  while orientation of a mesh is straightforward for simplex cells andis a local operation  it is not a strictly local operation for quadrilateralcells and in the case of hexahedral cells not all meshes are orientable. Thepermutation and transformation approach is developed for a range of elementtypes  including Lagrange  and divergence- and curl-conforming elements  andfor a range of cell shapes. The approach is local and can be applied to cellsof any shape  including general polytopes and meshes with mixed cell types. Anumber of examples are presented and the developed approach has beenimplemented in an open-source finite element library.
11901,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11901, Neural Ranking Models for Document Retrieval,Ranking models are the main components of information retrieval systems.Several approaches to ranking are based on traditional machine learningalgorithms using a set of hand-crafted features. Recently  researchers haveleveraged deep learning models in information retrieval. These models aretrained end-to-end to extract features from the raw data for ranking tasks  sothat they overcome the limitations of hand-crafted features. A variety of deeplearning models have been proposed  and each model presents a set of neuralnetwork components to extract features that are used for ranking. In thispaper  we compare the proposed models in the literature along differentdimensions in order to understand the major contributions and limitations ofeach model. In our discussion of the literature  we analyze the promisingneural components  and propose future research directions. We also show theanalogy between document retrieval and other retrieval tasks where the items tobe ranked are structured documents  answers  images and videos.

Humans needto understand and anticipate the actions taken by the machines for trustful andsafe cooperation. In this work  we aim to enable the explainability of anautonomous driving system at the design stage by incorporating expert domainknowledge into the model. We propose Grounded Relational Inference (GRI). Itmodels an interactive system's underlying dynamics by inferring an interactiongraph representing the agents' relations. We ensure an interpretableinteraction graph by grounding the relational latent space into semanticbehaviors defined with expert domain knowledge. We demonstrate that it canmodel interactive traffic scenarios under both simulation and real-worldsettings  and generate interpretable graphs explaining the vehicle's behaviorby their interactions.
11905,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11905, A predictive safety filter for learning-based racing control,The growing need for high-performance controllers in safety-criticalapplications like autonomous driving has been motivating the development offormal safety verification techniques. In this paper  we design and implement apredictive safety filter that is able to maintain vehicle safety with respectto track boundaries when paired alongside any potentially unsafe controlsignal  such as those found in learning-based methods. A model predictivecontrol (MPC) framework is used to create a minimally invasive algorithm thatcertifies whether a desired control input is safe and can be applied to thevehicle  or that provides an alternate input to keep the vehicle in bounds. Tothis end  we provide a principled procedure to compute a safe and invariant setfor nonlinear dynamic bicycle models using efficient convex approximationtechniques. To fully support an aggressive racing performance withoutconservative safety interventions  the safe set is extended in real-timethrough predictive control backup trajectories. Applications for assistedmanual driving and deep imitation learning on a miniature remote-controlledvehicle demonstrate the safety filter's ability to ensure vehicle safety duringaggressive maneuvers.
11906,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11906, Instance Specific Approximations for Submodular Maximization,For many optimization problems in machine learning  finding an optimalsolution is computationally intractable and we seek algorithms that performwell in practice. Since computational intractability often results frompathological instances  we look for methods to benchmark the performance ofalgorithms against optimal solutions on real-world instances. The mainchallenge is that an optimal solution cannot be efficiently computed forintractable problems  and we therefore often do not know how far a solution isfrom being optimal. A major question is therefore how to measure theperformance of an algorithm in comparison to an optimal solution on instanceswe encounter in practice.In this paper  we address this question in the context of submodularoptimization problems. For the canonical problem of submodular maximizationunder a cardinality constraint  it is intractable to compute a solution that isbetter than a  1-1/e \approx 0.63  fraction of the optimum. Algorithms like thecelebrated greedy algorithm are guaranteed to achieve this  1-1/e  bound on anyinstance and are used in practice.Our main contribution is not a new algorithm for submodular maximization butan analytical method that measures how close an algorithm for submodularmaximization is to optimal on a given problem instance. We use this method toshow that on a wide variety of real-world datasets and objectives  theapproximation of the solution found by greedy goes well beyond  1-1/e  and isoften at least 0.95. We develop this method using a novel technique that lowerbounds the objective of a dual minimization problem to obtain an upper bound onthe value of an optimal solution to the primal maximization problem.
