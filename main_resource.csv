http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11887,Title: Good Actors can come in Smaller Sizes: A Case Study on the Value of  Actor-Critic Asymmetry,"Actors and critics in actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms are
functionally separate, yet they often use the same network architectures. This
case study explores the performance impact of network sizes when considering
actor and critic architectures independently. By relaxing the assumption of
architectural symmetry, it is often possible for smaller actors to achieve
comparable policy performance to their symmetric counterparts. Our experiments
show up to 97% reduction in the number of network weights with an average
reduction of 64% over multiple algorithms on multiple tasks. Given the
practical benefits of reducing actor complexity, we believe configurations of
actors and critics are aspects of actor-critic design that deserve to be
considered independently."
http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11893,Title: Targeted False Data Injection Attack against DC State Estimation without  Line Parameters,"A novel false data injection attack (FDIA) model against DC state estimation
is proposed, which requires no network parameters and exploits only limited
phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. The proposed FDIA model can target specific
states and launch large deviation attacks using estimated line parameters.
Sufficient conditions for the proposed method are also presented. Different
attack vectors are studied in the IEEE 39-bus system, showing that the proposed
FDIA method can successfully bypass the bad data detection (BDD) with high
success rates of up to 95.3%."
http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11896,Title: Construction of arbitrary order finite element degree-of-freedom maps on  polygonal and polyhedral cell meshes,"We develop an approach to generating degree-of-freedom maps for arbitrary
order finite element spaces for any cell shape. The approach is based on the
composition of permutations and transformations by cell sub-entity. Current
approaches to generating degree-of-freedom maps for arbitrary order problems
typically rely on a consistent orientation of cell entities that permits the
definition of a common local coordinate system on shared edges and faces.
However, while orientation of a mesh is straightforward for simplex cells and
is a local operation, it is not a strictly local operation for quadrilateral
cells and in the case of hexahedral cells not all meshes are orientable. The
permutation and transformation approach is developed for a range of element
types, including Lagrange, and divergence- and curl-conforming elements, and
for a range of cell shapes. The approach is local and can be applied to cells
of any shape, including general polytopes and meshes with mixed cell types. A
number of examples are presented and the developed approach has been
implemented in an open-source finite element library."
http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11901,Title: Neural Ranking Models for Document Retrieval,"Ranking models are the main components of information retrieval systems.
Several approaches to ranking are based on traditional machine learning
algorithms using a set of hand-crafted features. Recently, researchers have
leveraged deep learning models in information retrieval. These models are
trained end-to-end to extract features from the raw data for ranking tasks, so
that they overcome the limitations of hand-crafted features. A variety of deep
learning models have been proposed, and each model presents a set of neural
network components to extract features that are used for ranking. In this
paper, we compare the proposed models in the literature along different
dimensions in order to understand the major contributions and limitations of
each model. In our discussion of the literature, we analyze the promising
neural components, and propose future research directions. We also show the
analogy between document retrieval and other retrieval tasks where the items to
be ranked are structured documents, answers, images and videos."
http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11903,Title: Grounded Relational Inference: Domain Knowledge Driven Explainable  Autonomous Driving,"Explainability is essential for autonomous vehicles and other robotics
systems interacting with humans and other objects during operation. Humans need
to understand and anticipate the actions taken by the machines for trustful and
safe cooperation. In this work, we aim to enable the explainability of an
autonomous driving system at the design stage by incorporating expert domain
knowledge into the model. We propose Grounded Relational Inference (GRI). It
models an interactive system's underlying dynamics by inferring an interaction
graph representing the agents' relations. We ensure an interpretable
interaction graph by grounding the relational latent space into semantic
behaviors defined with expert domain knowledge. We demonstrate that it can
model interactive traffic scenarios under both simulation and real-world
settings, and generate interpretable graphs explaining the vehicle's behavior
by their interactions."
http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11905,Title: A predictive safety filter for learning-based racing control,"The growing need for high-performance controllers in safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving has been motivating the development of
formal safety verification techniques. In this paper, we design and implement a
predictive safety filter that is able to maintain vehicle safety with respect
to track boundaries when paired alongside any potentially unsafe control
signal, such as those found in learning-based methods. A model predictive
control (MPC) framework is used to create a minimally invasive algorithm that
certifies whether a desired control input is safe and can be applied to the
vehicle, or that provides an alternate input to keep the vehicle in bounds. To
this end, we provide a principled procedure to compute a safe and invariant set
for nonlinear dynamic bicycle models using efficient convex approximation
techniques. To fully support an aggressive racing performance without
conservative safety interventions, the safe set is extended in real-time
through predictive control backup trajectories. Applications for assisted
manual driving and deep imitation learning on a miniature remote-controlled
vehicle demonstrate the safety filter's ability to ensure vehicle safety during
aggressive maneuvers."
http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11906,Title: Instance Specific Approximations for Submodular Maximization,"For many optimization problems in machine learning, finding an optimal
solution is computationally intractable and we seek algorithms that perform
well in practice. Since computational intractability often results from
pathological instances, we look for methods to benchmark the performance of
algorithms against optimal solutions on real-world instances. The main
challenge is that an optimal solution cannot be efficiently computed for
intractable problems, and we therefore often do not know how far a solution is
from being optimal. A major question is therefore how to measure the
performance of an algorithm in comparison to an optimal solution on instances
we encounter in practice.
In this paper, we address this question in the context of submodular
optimization problems. For the canonical problem of submodular maximization
under a cardinality constraint, it is intractable to compute a solution that is
better than a $1-1/e \approx 0.63$ fraction of the optimum. Algorithms like the
celebrated greedy algorithm are guaranteed to achieve this $1-1/e$ bound on any
instance and are used in practice.
Our main contribution is not a new algorithm for submodular maximization but
an analytical method that measures how close an algorithm for submodular
maximization is to optimal on a given problem instance. We use this method to
show that on a wide variety of real-world datasets and objectives, the
approximation of the solution found by greedy goes well beyond $1-1/e$ and is
often at least 0.95. We develop this method using a novel technique that lower
bounds the objective of a dual minimization problem to obtain an upper bound on
the value of an optimal solution to the primal maximization problem."
